# Thought Monitor

## Overview

The **Thought Monitor** is a Python-based script designed to analyze and track thought patterns using EEG data. It allows for real-time monitoring and interpretation of brain activity through different frequency bands like theta, gamma, and delta waves. The script can be extended and integrated with various neuro-instrumentation systems for further analysis and research.

This repository includes a basic implementation of **thought_monitor.py**, which simulates EEG data and analyzes the brain's activity using predefined frequencies. 

## Features

- **Simulated EEG data**: Generates signals representing different brainwave frequencies (theta, gamma, and delta).
- **Real-time monitoring**: Continuously monitors EEG signal strength and tracks changes over time.
- **Data visualization**: Displays the signal in real-time to understand the brain's frequency patterns.
- **Sound synthesis**: Generates sound output based on EEG signals to enhance the feedback loop.

## Requirements

To run **thought_monitor.py**, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`: For signal generation and data manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualizing EEG data.
- `scipy`: For signal processing and filtering.
- `sounddevice` (optional): For audio output based on EEG data.

You can install the necessary dependencies via `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy sounddevice
```

## Usage

### Running the Script

Once the necessary packages are installed, you can run **thought_monitor.py** from the terminal:

```bash
python thought_monitor.py
```

This will begin the EEG simulation and real-time visualization process. The script will continuously display a plot of the EEG signal along with the frequency bands and sound output.

### Configuring the EEG Simulation

You can modify the parameters of the EEG simulation within the script, including:

- **Frequency Bands**: Control the range of theta, gamma, and delta waves.
- **Amplitude**: Adjust the strength of the simulated EEG signal.

### Visualizing Brainwaves

The script generates a plot showing the frequency distribution in real time. The plot will update as the EEG signal changes, giving you insight into the brain's activity.

### Sound Output (Optional)

If you want to hear a sound output based on the EEG signal, ensure that `sounddevice` is installed and enabled in your environment. The script will play a tone based on the detected brainwave frequencies.
